							<p>
								<b>WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT FROM MY VISITS?</b>
								<br />
								Your first visit is 60-75 min long where I do a thorough intake discussing your chief concern, medical and family history, nutrition, lifestyle, current medications and supplements and health goals. It will also include a physical exam relative to your chief concern. After explaining and educating you on why you’re feeling the way you are, I will then provide you with an individualized treatment plan including dietary and lifestyle recommendations, possible supplementation and diagnostic blood work. If you have any blood work or diagnostic tests done over the last 2 years it may be helpful to bring them with you on your first visit.
								<br />
								During your second visit I will go over your blood work results and either modify your current plan or add new recommendations based on the findings. You will leave with a short-term and long-term plan in hand.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>WHAT METHODS OF TREATMENT DO YOU USE?</b>
								<br />
								I use a combination of the following therapeutic modalities:
								<ul>

									<li>Dietary and Lifestyle Counselling</li>
									<li>Botanical Medicine</li>
									<li>Clinical Nutritional Supplementation</li>
									<li>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture</li>
									<li>Injection therapies (i.e. Perineural therapy, Vitamin B12 injections)</li>
								</ul>

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>ARE MY VISITS COVERED BY INSURANCE?</b>
								<br />
								Most private health insurance policies cover Naturopathic medical services, anywhere between $500-$1000 per year. Please check with your insurance provider for details.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>HOW MANY VISITS WILL I NEED?</b>
								<br />
								This varies depending on the complexity of your case and the type of treatment you’re receiving. Initially you may need anywhere between 4-6 visits (30min-1hr each). Returning patients come back to see me 2-3 times per year to address new concerns.

							<p>
								As part of my services I also offer Perineural Injection Therapy (PIT) to eliminate pain. Read below for more information on these injections.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What is Perineural Injection Therapy (PIT)?</b>
								<br />
								Also known as “Neural Prolotherapy”, PIT involves subcutaneous injections of 5% dextrose or 1% procaine injected along the superficial nerve branches just under your skin, which will eventually reach deeper nerve branches and roots. PIT is an injection therapy aiming at resolving neurogenic pain and/or neurogenic inflammation. The injections result in immediate pain relief and overall improved quality of life.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>How does it work?</b>
								<br />
								Local inflammatory markers can result in neurogenic inflammation when nerves are injured, damaged or hypersensitive. The over production of inflammatory markers can result in chronic pain, stiffness, swelling, weakness, paresthesia and hypersensitivity to touch. Neurogenic pain may also be a result of chronically tight muscles or fascia, traumatic injury or underlying tendon or ligament dysfunction. PIT can be combined with other standard treatments to treat both acute pain as well as underlying causative dysfunction in the deeper connective tissues.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What is the course of treatment?</b>
								<br />
								Initial assessments are a standard 60-75 minute initial appointment in order to complete a full assessment of the affected area as well as general history taking. Follow-up injection appointments are 30 mins to allow frequent re-assessment, monitoring progress and administration of injections. Ideally, injections are administered once weekly for 3-6 weeks until symptoms subside, followed by injections as needed.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What conditions do PIT help with?</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Pain related conditions:</li>
									<li>Whiplash</li>
									<li>Concussions</li>
									<li>Chronic pain</li>
									<li>Chronic headaches</li>
									<li>Nerve entrapment or impingement</li>
									<li>Sciatic pain</li>
									<li>Joint pain</li>
									<li>Post-surgical pain and paresthesia</li>
									<li>Altered sensation of scar tissue</li>
									<li>Persistent sports injury</li>
								</ul>

							<p>
								<b>Mental health:</b>
								<br />
								Anxiety and depression can show up in many ways. If you’ve noticed a change in your motivation or energy levels, focus and concentration, sleep quality or digestion; it may be worth getting screened for mental health concerns. At times there are other health conditions such as hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that could be exacerbating your symptoms, which I can assess for.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Digestion:</b>
								<br />
								Taking care of your digestion is key to your overall health. Our gut health is strongly connected to our mental health and immune system, influencing each other all the time. Examples include anxiety causing indigestion and heartburn, or a food sensitivity causing joint pain. Testing for food sensitivities, hidden gut infections or disturbances in gut bacteria can guide us to the best treatment.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Hormonal health:</b>
								<br />
								Hormonal imbalances can lead to many different symptoms including heavy, painful periods, irregular cycles, mood changes, hot flashes, sleep disturbances, constipation, hair loss, acne, infertility and more. Whether it’s your thyroid hormones, your stress or sex hormones causing your symptoms, I’ll provide you with a plan to make sure they’re optimized and to improve your quality of life.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Pain management:</b>
								<br />
								Chronic pain can be disruptive to your quality of life by impacting your energy levels, mood, sleep quality and motivation. Managing your pain by taking painkillers may not be a sustainable solution in the long-term. I can provide you with alternative methods to manage your pain.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Fatigue:</b>
								<br />
								Very commonly seen in my practice, fatigue can show up in different ways. Whether you’re experiencing low energy, brain fog, cognitive dysfunction or lack of motivation we can work together to determine the underlying cause(s) and treat them in order to restore your energy levels. Common causes include nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, mood disorders, disturbed sleep, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Heart health and Metabolic Syndrome:</b>
								<br />
								Given our current modern lifestyle increasing our risk of heart disease, the smart move is to be proactive and start prevention today. Working together we determine your risk factors and I provide you with tools you need to optimize your heart health in the long run.
